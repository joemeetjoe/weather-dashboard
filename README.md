# weather-dashboard

## Description

-A web app to help you search for weather conditions. 

- I took this project on to learn how to use the open weather map API . 
- This site will help a user look up the weather in different cities around the world. When the user searches for a city, the user is presented with a 5 day forecast, a current day forecast, along with wind speeds, temperatures, and humidity. The search is then stored into local storage and a search history button for the user to be able to quickly navigate to later. 
- I learned many things on this project: How to use Open Weather API, more about bootstrap, how to read documentation for an API, how to navigate the data in an API, more about functions and controlling order flow.   
-If given more time on this project, I would like to do more to clean up user input, make the data responses more robust, and do more with the styling and responsiveness of the site.
